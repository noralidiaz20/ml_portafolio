Machine Learning (in progress)

# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed as part of my learning process in Machine Learning.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, show how I approach machine learning problems, and demonstrate my ability to understand, implement, and interpret different models.

## Contents
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Model evaluation and validation
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Practical exercises and experiments

## Tools
- R / Python (depending on the project)
- Common machine learning libraries
